* Original script by: http://www.guyrutenberg.com/2008/10/02/retrieving-googles-cache-for-a-whole-website/
* Ported to Python 3.x by Luka Pušić <luka@pusic.si> http://360percents.com

Usage:
-----
* Change the search_term variable.
* The script will probably stop working after ~150 requests, because Google will mark your behaviour as "suspicious" and the script will throw errors 503.
